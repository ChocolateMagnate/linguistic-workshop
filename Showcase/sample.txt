Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid,
solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed
in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority
of Mesoamerican people ─ including the Maya and Aztecs ─ made chocolate beverages.

The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the
flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to
produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form.
Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also
be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate,
also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions,
without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can
be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the
form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and
sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk.
White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.

Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs
involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate
brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened
chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate,
are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins)
are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and
Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot
chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.

Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d'Ivoire and
Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world
cocoa supply.

With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and
trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns. A 2018 report argued that
international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of
persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of
cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.
